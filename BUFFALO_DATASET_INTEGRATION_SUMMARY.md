Buffalo Breed Set Dataset-🐃.

✅ SUCCESS: Buffalo Breed Set Successfully Integrated!

Hey team, we have just completed our integration of the Buffalo Breed Set into our classification pipeline, it has all the features and it is good to go.

Dataset Processing Results:  

There are 421,143,127 records in the table of buffalo breed set statistics📊 Buffalo Breed Set Statistics:  
- Number of images that have been processed: 168 images.  
- Processing Status: ✅ Complete  
- data: processed data framing buffalo dataset/ processed buffalo dataset/data.  
- Improved Dataset: improved final dataset/

What Was Created🚀:  

1. Dataset Processing Scripts:  
- quick_buffalo_processing.py- fast processing version.  
- process_buffalo_breed_set.py - complete, proceduralšu.py  
- train_buffalo_model.py- the training command.

2. The Processed Dataset Structure.

Files Created / Updated(📁):  

New Scripts  
- quick_buffalo_processing.py  
- process_buffalo_breed_set.py  
- train_buffalo_model.py  
- create new dataset.py- overall dataset creation.  
- retrain_with_new-dataset.py - to retrain the model.

Dataset Directories

Metadata Updates  
- cattle_buffalo_model_metadata.json

How to Use🎯:  

1. Process New Datasets  
```bash
python quick_buffalo_processing.py
```

2. Train Model  
```bash
python train_buffalo_model.py
```

3. Make Use of Existing System.  
```bash
python retrain_with_new_dataset.py
```

Next Steps🚀:  

1. Training Finish Model Training – execute the script until completion, test, check accuracy.  
2. Update Main System – simply add the new classifier to the cattle vs buffalo workflow, refresh the breed DB, end-to-end tests.  
3. Install Back-end upgrade Flask, run test of web interface, and deploy to production.
