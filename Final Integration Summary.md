Comprehensive Dataset Integration.🎉

Integration of all Datasets Completed SUCCESSFULLY

Your classification system of cattle vs buffalo has been improved successfully using THREE datasets:

1. Effnet Layer: cow-and-buffalo.v1i. tensorflow (256 images)
2. YOLO Dataset: buffalo vs cow computer vision model (480 annotations)
3. Dataset of cattle breed: cattle breed (250 sample images)
